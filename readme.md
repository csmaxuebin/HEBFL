# Abstract
Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning method, which can effectively protect the privacy of participants. There are many security problems in traditional federated learning. For example, the intermediate gradients uploaded by participants may cause serious privacy leakage. Attackers can damage the accuracy of the global model by uploading malicious models. Besides, stragglers may reduce the accuracy of the global model because of their stale model. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a blockchain-based privacy preserving framework HEBFL. We use the model weights encryption mechanism based on partitioning aggregation strategy to protect each participant's privacy, propose the malicious-lazy node detecting and disposing mechanism to identify and dispose of malicious nodes and lazy nodes, and design the optimized asynchronous mechanism to mitigate the negative impact on the global model from stragglers. Finally, we implement a prototype of HEBFL and conduct some experiments on several real datasets. The privacy analysis and the results of the experiments show that our proposed framework can achieve better performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and privacy.
